# TODO: write a script that initiates the model from an existing .weights file and uses it to detect and classify fish
#   in an image. Likely similar to the _evlauate_epoch method of the Trainer class, but with more control over which
#   images are fed in and some extra code to set up the model.


class Detector:

    def __init__(self):
        pass
